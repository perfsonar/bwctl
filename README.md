### Notes from August 2018
The code from this repository will not be further developed by the perfSONAR development team.  Only security issues will still be considered and corrected from now on.  See https://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/manage_update.html#special-upgrade-notes for more information.

# bwctl

bwctl is a scheduling and policy daemon that wraps iperf, traceroute, owamp and
a few other measurement tools. It works by contacting a bwctld process on the
remote system and on the local system and requests that those daemons perform a
specific iperf test between them.  The bwctl software uses the "autoconf" tools
to prepare a build process. It is distributed with a pre-built "configure"
script - so the "autoconf" tools should not be needed. (gnumake may be
required... I have not tried using other versions of make.)

bwctl does require a reasonably synchronized clock. (It is
scheduling tests and needs to be sure it has the same general concept of
when a test should take place as the peer system the test is being done with.)
Therefore bwctl requires ntp be installed and used to synchronize the system
clock.

## Building bwctl

### Prerequisites
* I2util: You can install it via RPM, or download the source from http://software.internet2.edu/sources/I2util/
* iperf3 (optional): You can install it via RPM, or download the source from https://github.com/esnet/iperf/

### Building

```bash
./configure; make; make install
```

(Note: If configure fails, try running ./bootstrap.sh first)

## Latest version

To check out the most recent code, do:  git clone https://github.com/perfsonar/bwctl.git

## Running

### Daemon

To run the daemon:

```bash
bwctld -c /path/to/directory/with/bwctl-server.conf
```

The daemon will run without a bwctld configuration file if you use enough
of the command-line flags - but it is much easier to use the config file.
There is an example configuration file in conf/bwctl-server.conf.

To get the list of available options use:

```bash
bwctld -h
```

bwctld -h will give you the list of options. Specifically, if you have problems you may want to use the -Z flag to run it in the foreground and have error messages come to the console in addition to syslog.

### Client

To run the client:

```bash
bwctl [options] [-c catchhost] [-s sendhost]
```

At least a -c or a -s must be specified to indicate the direction of the
test. If only one of them is specified, the local host is assumed to be
the other one. If a local bwctld is not running, then bwctl will
execute the bwctld functionality required to run the test.

To get the list of available options use:

```bash
bwctl -h
```

The bwctl program will allow you to run bandwidth tests like iperf, iperf3 and
nuttcp. To run traceroute/tracepath, use the 'bwtraceroute' program, and to use
ping/owamp, use the 'bwping' program.
